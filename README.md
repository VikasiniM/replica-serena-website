# Dr. Serena Blake - Therapist Website (Frontend Assignment)

This is a fully responsive therapist website built as part of an internship assignment. The goal was to replicate the reference website [https://www.drjenniferhahm.com](https://www.drjenniferhahm.com) using *Next.js 14* and *Tailwind CSS*, focusing only on the frontend implementation with pixel-perfect accuracy.

## 👩‍⚕ Project Overview

The website presents Dr. Serena Blake, a licensed therapist, and includes her introduction, services, FAQs, and a contact form for new patients. Every section was carefully crafted to match the layout, typography, and spacing of the reference site.
